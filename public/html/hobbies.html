			<dt> <!-- Definition term --> The campus </dt>
				<dd> <!-- Definition --> There are so many components of Pitt's campus that I love. I really like the atmosphere, architecture, and expanse of the campus. The atmosphere has always been very friendly and clean. I appreciate the many different types of architecture, such as Benedum and Cathy. Although the walk from Forbes to Alumni Hall is rather long, I enjoy the size of the campus. </dd>
			<dt> The people	</dt>
				<dd> The large majority of people I have met at Pitt have been very nice. Most of the professors are informative and entertaining while teaching their classes. The Teaching Assistants have also been clear and helpful for explaining any confusing material from the courses. The students have all been kind and I found making friends rather easy. </dd>
			<dt> The city </dt>
				<dd> I love the city of Pittsburgh and exploring it. There are so many activities to do and the transportation systems make it easy to get almost anywhere. Each week, I am able to discover something new to do or somewhere new to go. The city has made going out with friends very enjoyable. </dd>
			<dt> The food </dt>
				<dd> The cuisine in Pittsburgh has wide variety and great taste. I enjoy the many options of places to eat, even just on Forbes Avenue. It is also great to explore parts of Pittsburgh to find new places to eat each week. I already have favorite places to eat with my friends and the list is expanding. </dd>
			<dt> The sports </dt>
				<dd> I love the many options that Pittsburgh offers for sporting events. Going to the Pittsburgh Pirates&#39 game with other engineers was a great way to meet people at the start of the term. I also thoroughly enjoy going to the Pitt Panthers football games with my friends and singing Sweet Caroline. </dd>
			<dt> The courses </dt>
				<dd> I love the courses at Pitt for many reasons. They provide the information I need to become successful in the future as an Engineer. They can be both challenging and entertaining at the same time. Although many of the courses can be rough, it is always enjoyable to learn something new. </dd>
