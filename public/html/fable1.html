			<h1> <i>The Lazy Student &amp; his Study Group</i></h1>
			<p><tab />A Student happened to walk past the study room of his university’s dorm. There he saw the fellow members of his Study Group dutifully preparing for the upcoming midterm. </p>

			<p><tab />The Student considered himself smart, but he lacked the motivation to apply himself to his studies. So he imagined that all he needed to do well in his classes was to complete his homework and trust his intuition to pass the exams. </p>

			<p><tab />He asked his Study Group, “Excuse me. Would you mind terribly if I checked my homework answers with yours?” Of course, his only intention was to copy them.</p>

			<p><tab />“Go ahead,” they replied. “You are welcome to stay and study with us as well.”</p>

			<p><tab />“Please!” scoffed the Student. “That is a waste of my time.”	</p>

			<p><tab />Once the Student had all the answers he needed, he started to leave, but the Study Group had realized his intentions. “Do not bother coming back!” they called. “This group is for helping each other learn, and you have contributed nothing.”</p>

			<p><tab />The day of the midterm came and went, and the Student was shocked to see he scored the lowest in the class. The defeated Student returned to his former companions for help, but they had not forgotten his superior airs toward them. They held true to their words and never allowed the Student to work with them again.</p>
