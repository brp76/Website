				<dt><b>Robotics Engineer</b></dt>
					<dd> A robotics engineer mainly deals with creating robots and robotic systems. They typically have a background in computer, mechanical, and/or electrical engineering. The systems they create are able to perform duties for people that they are unable to do or prefer not to do themselves. Robots are useful because they can vastly improve the efficiency and safety of many jobs. Theses attributes are especially useful in the manufacturing industry. 
					<br /> The work of a robotics engineer involves a very precise process. First, they must complete research to determine the function of a robot. Then they design the software systems and build the robots. This part can take a long time, so it is necessary for robotics engineers to have patience. They also test and analyze the performance of the robots to improve efficiency and safety. </dd>
				<dt><b>Project Manager</b></dt>
					<dd> A project manager in the engineering fields must plan, organize, secure, and manage resources to successfully lead a group to achieve project goals. A project manager is an integral part of a company, because they make sure everything is running smoothly.
					<br /> There are many attributes a project manager must have to be effective at their job. For instance, they need to have good communication skills if they want to state their goals and efficiently lead a group. They should also have sufficient knowledge and experience of the field of engineering they are managing to understand the project and constraints. </dd>
