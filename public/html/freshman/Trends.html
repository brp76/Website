		<!-- Introduction of self-driving cars -->
		<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
			<p> Recently, the development of automated cars has become an increasingly more present topic on the technological radar. Self-driving vehicles is an important topic, because its development can lead to safer and more efficient transportation. Under this topic, a vital component of technology is the use of sensor systems. Many scientists and engineers are supportive of the development of this technology. However, some concerns exist from the public about the safety of automated cars and these sensors. As an aspiring computer engineer, I believe that this technology is safe and could provide reliable and efficient transportation if it is invested in. </p>

		<h2> SENSORS IN AUTOMATED CARS </h2>
			<p> The core component of self-driving car technology is the use of sensor systems. Google is currently developing one of the most advanced self-driving cars. Their cars utilize many cameras, laser systems, and radar systems that work harmoniously to monitor and react to the surroundings. The most important sensor is located on top of the vehicle and is known as a LIDAR laser remote sensing system. Provided by Velodyne, this sensor has 64 laser beams and can rotate 360-degrees to operate in a range of 100 meters with extremely high accuracy [1]. This laser system is very important for the operation of automated cars. When combined with the other sensors located around the vehicle, the software of the car can recognize and react to the road, cars, pedestrians, and hazards [2]. With these capabilities, Google&#39;s self-driving cars can already safely and effectively drive on various roads. However, much more research and development of the sensors is required to implement the automated cars onto modern roads. </p>

		<h2> HOW DO THEY WORK? </h2>
			<p> To explain how the sensors work, the LIDAR system will be the main focus. The Velodyne LIDAR system that Google utilizes in their cars has 64 laser beams. Essentially, the sensor works by emitting the beams, which will hit a surface and bounce back to the sensor that has receivers to measure the distance the lasers travelled. The 64-beam LIDAR system is composed of 4 groups of 16 laser emitters and 2 groups of 32 receivers and has the capability to spin at 900 RPM [3]. Since these emissions all occur while the system is rotating, the system is able to produce a very high quality image of the surroundings. Even a 32 beam LIDAR system at an auto show saw &#34;not only other vehicles, buildings and signs, but also pedestrians on the sidewalks and even picked up cracks in the pavement and worn paint in crosswalks&#34; [4]. This capability is a significant demonstration of the amazing technology of these sensors. The primary focuses for improving these sensors include increasing the range, the number of beams, and decreasing the size. </p>

		<h2> IMPORTANCE OF SENSORS </h2>
			<p>The development and research of the technology of these sensors is highly invaluable thanks to the many benefits they provide. The need to invest in this technology is very important, but it must overcome many boundaries until self-driving cars can be implemented onto modern roads. </p>

		<h2> Obstacles </h2>
			<p> When it comes to safely and effectively implementing self-driving cars with society, companies have to face the concerns of the consumers, because they ultimately determine the success of the product. According to a study by KPMG&#39;s automotive team, one major concern many people have about self-driving cars is their safety [5]. Even the slightest risk shown from the cars can cause a stir of panic among people, because the technology is new and involves people entrusting their lives with it. A vast amount of people are concerned with how the cars can react in unpredictable situations, such as wandering pedestrians or reckless drivers. To ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians, Google has integrated several considerate features in their vehicles. For example, the car has a top speed of 25 mph, its front consists of a foam bumper and flexible windshield, and it provides seatbelts and an emergency braking system for the passengers [2]. However, the fairly low speed can be viewed as a significant drawback for the car to make it onto many modern roads, because having a higher top speed is vital for the integration of these automated cars with the fast and reckless cars controlled by people. Therefore, I believe it is imperative to devote time towards better sensor systems, because they can detect dangers and surprises more quickly and farther away. Thus, the improved sensor systems would allow for safer, yet faster cars that would fare better on modern roads. Another concern that consumers have involves the reliability of the software that is associated with the sensors [4]. Based on their past experiences, many participants in KPMG&#39;s study stated they were wary of &#34;software crashes, security breaches and imperfect maps&#34; [5]. Although the navigation and radar detection are generally very reliable, these concerns further emphasize the need to improve the sensor systems and software technology. </p>

		<h2> Benefits </h2>
			<p> Although there are currently limitations of the automated vehicles, the benefits that the sensor technology offers often outweigh them in the minds of many consumers. Despite a large fear for safety from certain people, there are also many people who know that the sensors and computer are much more reliable than people. For instance, in KPMG&#39;s study, one participant stated, &#34;I would trust that car more than I&#39;d trust a bus driver in Manhattan. I&#39;d trust that car more than I&#39;d trust myself&#34; [5]. This perspective is very significant, since it demonstrates how people do realize that the sensors have much better awareness and reactions than humans do and that human drivers are typically more dangerous and spontaneous. Even though this technology is much safer than human drivers, it could take several years to convince the mass public this fact. However, there are many other benefits that come with this technology that people are much more amiable about. For instance, the capabilities of the sensor system could potentially reduce commute time by a significant amount if there was more widespread use of automated vehicles. It also provides much more accessible transportation for the elderly and people with disabilities. From a wider perspective, automated cars are very appealing to companies and automotive experts. One of the greatest qualities of self-driving cars is that they will adjust to surrounding traffic and road hazards [4]. This quality could greatly relieve traffic congestion and provide a safer driving environment compared to a distracted driver. </p>

		<h2> Investments </h2>
			<p> With the rapid growth of research towards automated cars, many companies have already invested in developing better technology for them, specifically concerning the sensors. Originally well known for their subwoofers, Velodyne, the company that provides the LIDAR sensors for Google&#39;s cars, has recently become heavily invested in research for their sensors. Velodyne introduced a new sensor in September of 2014 that is a much smaller and cheaper sensor than the current sensors that Google has been using, costing approximately $20,000 to $70,000 less [6]. This research is very economically significant, because cheaper sensors allow for great steps towards making the automated cars affordable and available for commercial production.  The smaller sensor also allows for improvements in the compactness of the automated cars with the ability to incorporate it in the side mirrors and other discrete places [6]. However, the smaller sensor only has 16 laser beams compared to the 64 laser beam sensor that Google prefers. Although this sensor is compact, it is not nearly as powerful and precise. So, this technology requires much more investment to be able to produce the more powerful sensors in the same miniature manner. The development of sensor technology has also provided opportunities for plastics suppliers to invest in automated cars. Plastics are a vital component for the success of the sensors, because they do not interfere with the electronics in the way that metal does [4]. Clearly, the technology of sensor systems is a good economic investment for expanding the research of autonomic cars. </p>

		<h2> PERSONAL STANCE </h2>
			<p> As an aspiring Computer Engineer, I believe that this technology is extremely important for the improvement of everyone&#39;s lives. I believe that investing time and money in developing these sensors will yield very positive benefits for many people. For instance, it will make the roads safer while also making them more efficient. I consider this technology to be more important than investing in normal automobiles, because eliminating human error and slow reaction speeds will have major effects on reducing accidents. In my opinion, modern roads seem very dangerous for both drivers and pedestrians. I feel that others should also be supportive of this technology, because it will ultimately save lives, which could include theirs. </p>

		<h2> CONCLUSION </h2>
			<p> Overall, the technology of sensors in automated cars is one that should be heavily invested in to improve and protect the lives of everyone. The LIDAR systems along with other sensors are vital components of self-driving cars that allow them to accurately monitor and react to the environment. Although many people have concerns for their safety, they should realize that these sensors are extremely reliable and much safer than a human driver. Investing in better sensor systems will create safer, more efficient transportation and many economic benefits. As a future engineer, I cannot stress enough how important this technology is in terms of saving countless people&#39;s lives. </p>
