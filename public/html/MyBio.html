		<p> Hello, my name is Ben Posey and I am a freshman engineer at the Swanson School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I currently live in Forbes Hall which houses the Freshman Engineering Living Learning Community. </p>
		<!-- Early life and high school -->
		<p> I was born on November 21<sup>st</sup>, 1995 in Philadelphia, PA. I lived there for three years until my family moved to Exton, PA. I went to school in the Downingtown Area School District where I graduated from the Downingtown STEM Academy in 2014. During my high school years, I played the flugelhorn in marching band and became section leader in my senior year. Outside of school, I worked with We Grow Hope to help harvest and donate over 1000 pounds of crops to the Chester County Food Bank. I also had the opportunity to participate in an internship at West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. where I gained valuable work experience from the Research and Development department. </p>
		<!-- Personal interests -->
		<p> One of my favorite recreational activities is skiing. I have been skiing for over 10 years. Personally, I enjoy skiing because of the winter atmosphere and the adrenaline rush from going down mountains at high speeds. I also enjoy playing video games. They can be very fun and immersive and have contributed to the inspiration for me to pursue Engineering. </p>
		<!-- Forbes Hall -->
		<p> Living in Forbes Hall with the Freshman Engineering Living Learning Community has been extremely beneficial for my experience at Pitt. I found that living with other engineers has been very useful for reducing distractions and improving my work efficiency since others can provide help and clear up questions for tough assignments. In addition, it is a fun place to live in and make friends because I share interests with many people here. The competitions and floor activities each week have been exciting and a great way to meet new people and have some fun. </p>
