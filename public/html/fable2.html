			<h1><i>The Teacher &amp; the Students</i></h1>
			<p><tab />A Teacher was lecturing her elementary school Students one afternoon, but they were getting antsy as recess was approaching. Whenever she turned her back on the Students, giggling and chattering erupted from them.</p>

			<p><tab />At first, she politely warned the Students, “Dear children, please be quiet, or I will keep you inside during recess.”</p>

			<p><tab />For a while, the Students went mute, but they soon remembered that they could still have fun playing inside with board games or toys. They returned to their conversations and again paid no attention to the Teacher.</p>

			<p><tab />The Teacher saw that she would have to take other measures. She finally announced to the class, “Hush, children! For the next one that talks will be put into timeout.”</p>

			<p><tab />One defiant Student did not believe her and started talking again, but she quickly made an example of him. She sent him to stand in the corner of the room where he could talk to no one. This had the effect the Teacher wanted, as all the other Students remained silent for the rest of the lesson. For their good behavior, they were allowed to go outside while the disruptive Student was left behind.</p>
