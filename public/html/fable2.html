			<h1>The Tuna &amp; the School of Fish</h1>

			<p>A Tuna was lecturing her School of Fish one afternoon to prepare for their upcoming midterm, but they were getting antsy as spring break was approaching. Whenever she turned her back on the School of Fish, giggling and chattering erupted from them.</p>

			<p>At first, she politely warned them, “Please be quiet. If you would rather talk than review the material, I imagine you are all ready for the midterm.”</p>

			<p>However, the School of Fish returned to their conversations and again paid no attention to the Tuna. After all, the midterm was not until after break.</p>

			<p>The Tuna saw that she would have to take greater measures. She finally announced to the class, “Hush! If anyone interrupts me again, you will all take the midterm today.” </p>

			<p>For a while, the School of Fish went mute, but they figured no professor would be so cruel to follow through on that kind of threat. Once again, the class began talking. This time the Tuna was serious, so she passed out the exam. Much of the class floundered through the exam, but from that day on the School of Fish took the Tuna much more seriously.<br><br></p>
